        <Para content={`The Ministry of Ayush was established on November 9, 2014, with the vision of reviving and promoting the profound knowledge of Indiaâ€™s ancient systems of medicine. It aims to ensure the holistic development and global propagation of Ayush systems of healthcare, which include Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy.`} />

        <Para content={`Before its formation, these traditional systems were managed under the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM&H), which was created in 1995. In November 2003, the department was renamed as the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to emphasize focused attention on education and research in these ancient disciplines. The establishment of a dedicated Ministry of Ayush in 2014 was a major step toward integrating these holistic health practices into mainstream healthcare and education.`} />
